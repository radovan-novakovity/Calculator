A semi-functional clone of the iOS calculator built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, created as part of the Intro to JavaScript course at Frontend Masters.

## It features  
- Supports integer-based calculations for the four basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)  
- Backspace/delete functionality to correct input  
- Clear memory (reset) button  
- Responsive layout mimicking iOS calculator UI

## Takeaway from the project:  
- How to structure a simple web component (calculator) with semantic markup and styles  
- Working with JavaScript to handle user input, state (current value vs previous value) and UI updates  
- Using CSS Flexbox to create a clean, mobile-friendly layout  
- Challenges around edge cases (e.g., dividing by zero, multiple digit input) and how to manage them

## Used:
- HTML  
- CSS (Flexbox layout)  
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation & event handling)
